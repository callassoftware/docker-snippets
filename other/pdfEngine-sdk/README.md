# Docker Snippets for Callas PDFEngine SDK

> **Note:** Unlike `pdfToolbox`, `pdfaPilot`, or `pdfChip`, there are no prebuilt "ready-to-use" Docker images for the **PDFEngine SDK** on Docker Hub. This is because the PDFEngine SDK is not a standalone application, but a **Software Development Kit** intended for building custom applications.

To demonstrate how to containerize a typical use case, this repository provides an example Dockerfile. It uses a **modified version of a precompiled C sample application** and is configured to work with an **Callas License Server** (instead of relying on a local activation). This serves as a practical reference to highlight all necessary prerequisites and setup steps.

---

## Step 1: Download and Unpack the SDK

```bash
wget https://www.callassoftware.com/extranet/callas_pdfEngineSDK/callas_pdfEngineSDK_x64_Linux_16-0-657.tar.gz
tar xzf callas_pdfEngineSDK_x64_Linux_16-0-657.tar.gz
mv callas_pdfEngineSDK_x64_Linux_16-0-657 callas_pdfEngineSDK_16-0-657
```

---

## Step 2: Patch and Rebuild the Sample Application

```bash
cd callas_pdfEngineSDK_16-0-657/sample-C
patch -p0 < ../../pdfToolboxSample.cpp.patch
cd unix
gmake
```

> **Troubleshooting:**  
If you encounter the following linker error:

```
/usr/bin/ld: lib/libpdfEngine.so: undefined reference to `std::basic_stringstream<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >::basic_stringstream()@GLIBCXX_3.4.26'
```

You may need to create a symbolic link to fix it:

```bash
cd lib
ln -s libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so
```

---

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t callassoftware/pdfengine:v16-0-657 -f Dockerfile-debian .
```

---

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

You can now run the image to test an example operation, such as text extraction from a PDF:

```bash
docker run --rm -ti   -e 'CALLAS_LICENSESERVER_URLS=10.0.0.64;10.0.0.37' \
                      -e 'CALLAS_LICENSESERVER_MSG=asdfasdfasdfsdfsdf'   \
                      callassoftware/pdfengine:v16-0-657  \
                      ./pdfToolboxSample ignore ignore --extracttext sample.pdf sample.txt
```

This will use the `sample.pdf` included in the Docker image and extract its text to `sample.txt`.

## Notes

### 1. License Server Integration

Because Docker containers don't support local hardware-based license activations, you must use **Callas License Servers** via environment variables:

- `CALLAS_LICENSESERVER_URLS`:  
  One or more license server IPs or hostnames, separated by semicolons.

- `CALLAS_LICENSESERVER_MSG`:  
  An optional wallet ID required by **cloud-based** license servers. For **on-premise** setups, this is typically optional (it is the aequivalent of the --lsmessage CLI argument for pdfToolbox, pdfaPilot and pdfChip CLIs)

### 2. Placeholder Keycodes

The two `ignore` values in the example command represent placeholder keycodes. These are normally required when running the unmodified sample app locally but are ignored in this Docker-based setup. You can use any arbitrary strings in their place.
